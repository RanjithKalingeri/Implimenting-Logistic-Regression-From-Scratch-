## Description 

1. Logistic Regression(with and with out regularization)  is Implimented From Scratch Using Python Programming Language 
2. Logistic Regression is Implimented Using MNIST Data Set 
3. Behaviour of Loss of model(with normal cost function) with respect to Number of Epoch is analysed
4. Behaviour of Loss of Model(with L2 Regularized cost function) with respect to different value of λ = 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and number of epochs is analyzed.    
5. Behaviour of Loss of Model(with L2 Regularized cost function) with respect to different value of λ = 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and Learning Rate is analyzed .  


## About Data Set

MNIST Data Set 
---------------------
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

## MNIST Data Set was Imported From Keras Python Library 

## Math behind Implimentation 

source adding still in progress..
