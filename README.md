## Description 

1. KNN is Implimented From Scratch Using Python Programming Language on MNIST Data Set 
2. A comparitive study on Classification Rate Vs Different values of K is done

## About Data Set

MNIST Data Set 
---------------------
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

## MNIST Data Set was Imported From Keras Python Library 

## Math behind Implimentation 

source adding still in progress..
